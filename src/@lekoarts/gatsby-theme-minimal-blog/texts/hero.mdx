    <p>
        Howdy, I'm Mihir! I was born and raised in Bihar (no, I don't have an
        accent), and am currently living in Kolkata. I am a Software Engineer and Data Analysis enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful
        to me. As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail,
        my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally
        change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started in tech with internships, freelance service and part time positions during college. Shortly after graduating from <span style={{color: "red"}}>Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology</span>, I joined the engineering team at <span style={{color: "red"}}>Nomura Research Institute Financial Technologies</span> where I work on a comprehensive back office solution for implementing STP in post-trade lifecycle management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my positions utilized agile-like development processes using JIRA. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in Data Analysis and Software Engineering.
