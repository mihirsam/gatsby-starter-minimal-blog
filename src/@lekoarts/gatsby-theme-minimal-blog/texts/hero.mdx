    <Title num="01.  " text="  About Me" />
    <p>
        Howdy, I'm Mihir! I was born and raised in Bihar (no, I don't have an
        accent), and am currently living in Kolkata. I am a Software Engineer and Data Analysis enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful
        to me. As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail,
        my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally
        change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started in tech with internships, freelance service and part time positions during college. Shortly after graduating from <span style={{color: "red"}}>Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology</span>, I joined the engineering team at <span style={{color: "red"}}>Nomura Research Institute Financial Technologies</span> where I work on a comprehensive back office solution for implementing STP in post-trade lifecycle management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my positions utilized agile-like development processes using JIRA. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in Data Analysis and Software Engineering.

            Convolutional Neural Networks have in the past years shown
            break-through results in some NLP tasks, one particular task is
            sentence classification, i.e., classifying sentence into a set of
            pre-defined categories and use them to generate a summary. Generated
            summary scores upto 64% on different datasets which almost twice of
            accepted score of 35%.

        <p style={{ "font-size": "20px" }}>
            In this project, I have trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict
            sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be
            practically used by any company with social media presence to
            automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e. whether their
            customers are happy or not) or to detect toxic comments. The process
            could be done automatically without having humans manually review
            thousands of tweets and customer reviews.

</div>
<div>
    <p style={{ "font-size": "20px" }}>
        Stock Management System is a software system for tracking inventory
        levels, orders, sales and deliveries. It can also be used in the
        manufacturing industry to create a work order, bill of materials and
        other production related documents. Companies use stock management
        software to avoid product overstock and outages. It is a tool for
        organizing inventory data that before was generally stored in
        hard-copy form or in spreadsheets. Open-source and clean code
        structure makes it easy to add new modules for anyone.
